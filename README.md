## Rosyverse

Rosyverse is an evolving pre-CRAN set of packages maintained by Brandon
Rose, MD, MPH. It is important to continue to run
`Rosyverse::update_all()` while you are using this set of related
packages. Please out if there are issues with installation,
documentation, or packages.

``` r
# install remotes package if you don't have it
# install.packages("remotes") 
# install Rosyverse metapackage which has a function called `update_all()`
remotes::install_github("brandonerose/Rosyverse")
Rosyverse::update_all() # run update on all packages
Rosyverse::load_all() #load all Rosyverse packages!
```

If you have any issues above download the most recent version of R at
RStudtio and update all packages in RStudio. See
[thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started](https://www.thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started "R Getting Started").

## REDCapDB Installation
